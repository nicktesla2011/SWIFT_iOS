/* Swift uses 3 collection types
 • Arrays
 • Sets
 • Dictionaries
 
 This Playground concerns itself with Dictionaries
 A Dictionary defined in Swift 2.2 is a collection of unordered Key Value Associations.
 What does that mean?
 Unlike Arrays Which have an order (0,1,2,etc) Dictionaries do 
 not have that strict order.
 
 What a Dicitionary has is an associated pair of a key and logical value associated with that key. For example
 Animal, Dog
 Earth, Continent
 Food, Burrito
 
 You create a Dictionary through this context
 
 var namesOfAnimals = [Canine: Dog, Avian: Bird, Reptile: Snake]
 
 WHEN TO USE A DICTIONARY?
 
 "You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition for a particular word."
 
 Remember: If your key and your value are both strings make sure you write your strings with quotes on both.

//Key Value pair with integers
